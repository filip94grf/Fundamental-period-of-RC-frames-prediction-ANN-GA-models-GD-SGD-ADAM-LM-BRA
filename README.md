# Fundamental-period-of-RC-frames-prediction-ANN-GA-models-GD-SGD-ADAM-LM-BRA

!!!Files contained Matlab and Python scripts for reproduction of the developed ANN algorithms for prediction of the FUNDAMENTAL PERIOD of MASONRY INFILLED RC FRAMES!!!

!!!Algorithms: Gradient descent, Stochastic gradient descent, Adaptive moment estimation, Levenberg-Marquardt and Bayesian regularization!!!

!!!Before you run the analysis you must specify the path of the dataset file to the designated place (filename)!!!

!!!To freeze your results which is important for comparison you must define random number in rng command (Matlab) or random.seed(seed_value) command (Python)!!!

!!!To run K-fold cross-validation technique you must specify number K!!!
