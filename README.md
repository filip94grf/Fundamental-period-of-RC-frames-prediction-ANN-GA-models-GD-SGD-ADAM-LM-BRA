# Fundamental-period-of-RC-frames-prediction-ANN-GA-models-GD-SGD-ADAM-LM-BRA

This repository contains user-friendly ANN and GA models for predicting the fundamental period of masonry infilled RC frame structures. These models can be applied to other areas as well through transfer learning approach, but they need to be adapted through the procedure of data normalization, validation, retraining and testing.

!!!Files contained Matlab and Python scripts for reproduction of the developed ANN algorithms for prediction of the FUNDAMENTAL PERIOD of MASONRY INFILLED RC FRAMES!!!

!!!Algorithms: Gradient descent, Stochastic gradient descent, Adaptive moment estimation, Levenberg-Marquardt and Bayesian regularization!!!

!!!Before you run the analysis you must specify the path of the dataset file to the designated place (filename)!!!

!!!To freeze your results which is important for comparison you must define random number in rng command (Matlab) or random.seed(seed_value) command (Python)!!!

!!!To run K-fold cross-validation technique you must specify number K!!!

!!!Files related to implementation of Genetic Algorithm are "AiC_GA_multiobjective_INFILLED" and "AiC_GA_nonlinear_constraints_INFILLED" (they must be active at the same time)
